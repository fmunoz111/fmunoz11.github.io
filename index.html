		<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
		<p>When I work with kids I really have to balance my brain and how I lead the kids.  I love working with kids and it can be so much fun, but you also have to stop and realize that how you behave, the words you use, and how you guide them is how they are going to do the same things.  I love to have fun and be animated when working with kids and let them have some free range.  If we are in public at a museum I want to show them excitement and wonder and explore, but I also want to show them how we behave in public, how we respect others while we do what we enjoy, and I stop and help them learn what they are curious about.  I help them learn how to do math, how to cook, respect, wander, how to use their resources, and the incredible impact they have on the world even as kids.  I do this by setting rules in place, by giving them the extra push they need, with discipline, with play therapy, with attention and love.

			<strong>Version 1</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Hello, I am Feliz Munoz.  I create websites and apps to help assist those affected by organ and tissue donation.  I do this as a web developer and in collaboration with Donate Life, OTAP, and hospitals in Albuquerque.  Do you know someone who is in need to a life saving transplant?

		<p>The photo above is a representation of my career now and where my future will be, hopefully, in three years.  On the left you see two animals who seem to be conflicting.  I feel like right now in my life I am the one with no antlers and I am conflicting with the programs we are learning.  I seem to be a little discuraged but have enough in me to fight the fight and come out on top. The photo on to the right is a representation showing where I hope to be in three years.  I have always wanted to be a mom.  I can't wait to raise my children and have the opportunity to work from home whether it be working for an IT company, freelance work, but I know that all the skills I am learning now will lead me to the day I can be a mom and be a working woman at the same time.</p>

		<p>Above is a visual representation of what I want to do in order to get to where I want to be.  The "burners" in the front are the ones are larger and the goals I have set in place right now for my future.  The smaller "burners" in the back are goals to work on in the background of my career path.  They are just as important to the whole goal.  As for the income in relation to my long term career goals, right out of bootcamp I am hoping for an internship where I can make at least $16 an hour.  In the long run let's say 5 years I am hoping for my sallary to be around $60,000-$75,000.  Within 10 years I would like to see myself above $100,000</p>

		<p>I feel like I learned from an early age that you have your work/professional side and then you have your you/personal side.  We used to even joke around with my mom when we were younger that we could tell who called her by the way she answered the phone.  As I got older, it was obvious why she did that and it helped me carry myself in a different way in the workplace or just any place that is more professional.  I feel like regardless in my life, I hold myself a certain way professionally and personally because I have made many connections in the community and I have to remember that always.  Of course with family and friends in more personal settings I let loose and am my authentic self.  But I also feel like my professional side is my authentic self, as well.  I feel at this point in life and for awhile now I have found that balance.</p>
