		<h1>Week 1 Reflection</h1>
		<p>Week one started off pretty good and there were things that i felt comfortable about.  I was familiar with html and phpStorm, but then it came to the back end and I was lost.  I had no clue how to change my mind to being a back end web developer after being a front end user my whole life.  Finding entities and attributes is difficult.  I had to leave early on Friday because I wasn't feeling well, and I wish I would have stuck it through.  I fell a little behind.  Overall, I felt successfull with the completetion of the first week of class.</p>
		<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>
		<p>This week was rough.  I ended last week feeling a bit "lost" or not knowing and that definitely continued this week.  I feel like everything we learned, went clear over my head.  I am definitely having to go home and self teach but it only makes sense.  I am having to try extra hard now for sure.  It was a challanging week, but I am not discouraged.</p>
		<h1>Week 3 Reflection</h1>
		<p>This week was a doozy.  Along with not fully understanding what is going on with the material I had some personal issues too.  I had to go to urgent care on Wednesday.  But other than that, on Thursday I was feeling extrememly defeated.  I had no idea what to do with the data design project at ta point where I was fixing errors.  I was sitting there trying to figure out someonething I couldn't even find the problem to.  My brain was fried.  George must have saw the defeat in my face and came over to help me out.  It is honeslty really hard to follow along with George's instruction and teaching style.  Last week, I honestly felt like the week and work went by but it completely passed me by too.  It is difficult following along with the way everything is taught. It is very vague.  I'm just not getting it.  I am staying positive and pushing along, but I wish I felt like I was confident in at least one thing so far.</p>
		<h1>Game Relfection</h1>
		<p>Playing the game was fun and interesting with my group.  With the prior instructions to watch how I interact and paying attention to my own behavior.  I noticed that at first I take the lead, which I feel like I normally do in situations.  My teammates each took on lead roles as well as the instructions and games went on.  I feel like when I am in a group with others who inch toward taking lead, I like to let them and I'll fall back.  On the other hand, if I can tell that no one else is wanting to take lead. I'll fully take on that role.  Also, I have a tendency to participate more in a lead role if someone tries, but is stuggling.  I like to pay attention to how others in the group respond to others too because that gives me a lot of insight to the dynamic of the group and from there I can partake in the appropriate ways.  In my group, everyone let everyone take a lead role, we helped one another, we played very well together and helped each other get a good understanding of the game.</p>
		<h1>Week 4 Relfection</h1>
		<p>This week was exciting and a week that I finally felt like I got a handle on things.  The past two weeks were a bit rough.  I am beyond happy with my the peers in my group.  I feel like we all have personalities that will work well together.  We seem to be communicating and working together very well.  The only thing I do not want to happen, is Michael taking on a big load of work because he is far beyond any of us at what we have learned so far.  He is very intelligent and so kind that he says he doesn't mind.  My only thing is that I want to learn too.  I am going to take this as an opportunity to learn from a peer as much as I can.  I appreciate that Michael is so helpful with all of us.  Sharon is awesome and is a good team player and communicates well.  Anthony is a bit more quiet but is starting to come out of his shell more and communicating when we all work together.  I feel like I am putting in as much effort as everyone else too and am doing my best to communicate well with everyone and stay on top of deadlines.  I seriously cannot believe that our half way mark is coming up this next week.  That's wild to me.  It's even more wild that in like 6 weeks I will be applying to jobs as a web developer.  Building my confidence in this title and continuing to learn is going to be intense. I'm excited.</p>
